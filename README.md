# Movie List Rest API

A Spring Boot application for tracking watched movies, developed as a portfolio demonstration project.

## About This Project

This application digitizes my personal movie-watching notebook. The core concept was to minimize custom frontend development by leveraging existing tools and applications where possible.

Beyond its practical use, this project serves as a demonstration of my Spring Boot development skills and architectural decision-making.

## Current Status

The project is currently at MVP stage and functional for personal use. Some features are still in development, and the API may evolve as new functionality is added.

**Next Priority:** Implementing comprehensive test coverage to enable confident refactoring and early error detection.

The application includes Swagger UI for API exploration (available after startup).
